## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues:
1. **Credit Abuse:** Users might use all credits immediately
   - **Mitigation:** Implement monthly credit limits that reset
   - **Mitigation:** Track usage patterns and flag anomalies

2. **Heavy AI Usage:** Enterprise users might exceed expected usage
   - **Mitigation:** AI costs are still minimal even at 1,000 features/month
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor per-user AI costs and set alerts

3. **Infrastructure Scaling:** Costs may increase with scale
   - **Mitigation:** Infrastructure costs typically decrease per user at scale
   - **Mitigation:** Use auto-scaling to optimize costs

## ✅ Recommended Adjustments (If Needed)

### Option 1: Reduce Credit Allocation (More Conservative)
- **Starter:** 30 credits/month (instead of 50) = ₱600 value
- **Professional:** 150 credits/month (instead of 200) = ₱3,000 value
- **Enterprise:** 800 credits/month (instead of 1,000) = ₱16,000 value

**Impact:** Increases profit margins by 1-2% while still providing good value

### Option 2: Add Credit Rollover Limits
- Credits roll over up to 2x monthly allocation
- Prevents hoarding and ensures steady usage

### Option 3: Tier Credit Pricing
- First 50 credits: Included
- Additional credits: ₱15 each (25% discount from base ₱20)
- Encourages usage while maintaining margins
